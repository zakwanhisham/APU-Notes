# Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and contextually relevant.
The overarching goal of NLP is to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding, allowing machines to interact with and process natural language data.

## Key components of NLP include:

1. **Text Understanding**:
   - Aims to enable machines to comprehend and extract meaning from textual data.
   - This involves tasks such as sentiment analysis, namely entity recognition, and text summarization.
2. **Language Generation**:
   - Encompasses the ability to generate human-like language.
   - This includes tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and dialogue systems, where machines can produce coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
3. **Speech Recognition**:
   - Extends to processing spoken language.
   - Speech Recognition technologies convert spoken words into text, enabling voice commands and dictation.
4. **Information Retrieval**:
   - Plays a crucial role in developing system that can efficiently retrieve relevant information from vast amounts of unstructured textual data.
   - Search engines, questions-answering systems, and content recommendation systems are examples of applications in information retrieval.

   - Fundamental to machine translation systems that translate text from one language to another.
   - This is especially important for breaking down language barriers in a globalized world.
6. **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**:
   - Powers the conversational abilities of chatbots and virtual assistants.
   - These systems understand user queries and respond in a manner that stimulates natural human conversation.
7. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Applied to analyze and determine the sentiment expressed in text.
   - This is widely used in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and opinion mining.
8. **Text Mining**:
   - Instrumental in extracting valuable insights from large volumes of textual data.
   - This includes identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the text for applications in business intelligence and research.

## 15 Key aspect of NLP text preprocessing and it's use cases

1. **Tokenization**:
   - Divide the text into smaller units, such as words or subwords.
   - Helps in creating a structured representation of the text.
   - Use libraries like NLTK or spaCy for tokenization.
   - Handle contractions appropriately to avoid splitting contracted words incorrectly.
   - _Use Cases_: `Sentiment Analysis`
     - Tokenization is crucial for breaking down user reviews or social media comments into individual words or tokens.
     - It helps in analyzing the sentiment associated with each word to determine overall sentiment.
2. **Lowecasing**:
   - Convert all characters to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
   - Prevents the model from treating words with different cases as different entities.
   - Beware of proper nouns and acronyms that may lose meaning when converted to lowercase.
   - _Use Case_: `Information Retrieval`
     - Lowercasing is essential when building search engines.
     - It ensures that the search process is case-insensitive, delivering relevant results regardless of the user's input case.
3. **Removing Punctuation**:
   - Eliminate punctuation marks to focus on the actual words.
   - Helps in maintaining consistency and reduces dimensionality.
   - Use regular expressions or built-in string functions to strip punctuations marks.
   - Consider exceptions where punctuation carries specific meaning (eg., "C++" or "$100")
   - _Use Case_: `Text Classification`
   - In spam detection, removing punctuation can enhance the accuracy of classifying emails.
   - Punctuation often doesn't contribute significantly to distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.
4. **Removing Stopwords**:
   - Remove common words (e.g., "and", "the", "is") that do not contribute much to the meaning.
   - Reduces noise and improves processing efficiency.
   - Utilize predefined lists of stopwords from NLP libraries.
   - Be cautious when removing stopwords in sentiment analysis or tasks where stopwords might carry significance.
   - _Use Case_: `Document Summarization`
     - Stopword removal is crucial when generating summaries.
     - Removing common words allows the model to focus on the most meaningful content, producing concise and informative summaries.
5. **Stemming and Lemmanization**:
   - Reduce words to their base or root form.
   - Stemming: Removes suffixes to obtain the root word (e.g., "running" to "run").
   - Lemmatization: Maps words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "better" to "good").
   - Choose between stemming for efficiency and lemmatization for a more accurate base word.
   - Use NLTK, spaCy, or other libraries for these processes.
   - _Use Case_: `Information Retrieval`
     - In search engines, stemming or lemmatization helps to match different forms of a word.
     - For instance, "running" and "ran" would both match the base form "run."
6. **Handling Numerical Values**:
   - Decide whether to keep or replace numbers in the text.
   - Options include converting numbers to words or removing them altogether.
   - Decide whether to keep numbers, convert them to words, or remove them.
   - Retain context-specific numbers (e.g., years, product codes) when relevant.
   - _Use Case_: `Customer Feedback Analysis`
     - Retaining numerical values in customer feedback analysis helps identify patterns related to ratings, product codes, or quantities mentioned in reviews.
7. **Handling Special Characters**:
   - Address special characters or symbols based on the specific requirements.
   - For some applications, certain symbols may carry important information.
   - Identify and process special characters based on the context.
   - Preserve special characters that carry meaning, such as "@" in email addresses.
   - _Use Case_: `Social Media Analysis`
     - Preserving hashtags or "@" mentions in social media text analysis allows tracking trends, mentions, or user interactions in the context of specific topics.
8. **Removing HTML Tags (if applicable)**:
   - If dealing with web data, remove HTML tags to extract the textual content.
   - Use `BeautifulSoup` or regular expressions to extract the text content from HTML.
   - Consider the impact of HTML entities on text representation.
   - _Use Case_: `Web Scraping for Content Extraction`
     - When extracting text from web pages, removing HTML tags ensures that only the textual content is processed, excluding irrelevant HTML markup.
